# LitPathExplorer

##Overview 

LitPathExplorer is a visual analytics tool for the joint exploration of pathway networks and
biomolecular events extracted from scientific literature. It was designed based on goals which were
established as part of several discussions with experts in the respective areas of signalling and
metabolic pathway modelling. In particular, we identified four major goals for our tool:

1. Enabling flexible search and exploration of biomolecular pathway networks through the
provision of different views of the data as well as various interactive functionalities.
2. We seek to provide a means for making existing evidence in the scientific literature available
to support corroboration of information contained in a given pathway model.
3. We aim to facilitate the discovery of potential new interactions that are not yet part of a given
model.
4. Within the context of the last two goals, we also quantify confidence in the events, which can
provide users of the model with further insight when they are searching for and analysing
interactions.
5. We seek to allow the user to become an active participant of the analytical process, where he
or she can explore, inspect and revise automatically extracted information, and even
potentially facilitate the iterative retraining or recalibration of the system according to this
feedback.
